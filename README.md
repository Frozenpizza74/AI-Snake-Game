# üêç AI Snake Game
This project is an AI-powered version of the classic Snake game, built using Python. The AI learns how to navigate the game environment, avoid collisions, and maximize its score by consuming food. It demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in a simple yet engaging environment.

## Features
- AI agent plays the game autonomously
- Pygame-based rendering
- Supports training and evaluation modes
- Clean, modular design

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Technologies
- Python
- Pygame
- Machine Learning (e.g., Q-learning, NEAT, or DQN)

## Educational Use
This project is ideal for understanding how reinforcement learning can be applied to classic games.
